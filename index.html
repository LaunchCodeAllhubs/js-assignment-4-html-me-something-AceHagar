            <h2>A Love for Music</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My first experience with a musical instrument was the saxaphone in 7th grade band. 
             While I played saxaphone throughout my junior high and highschool years,
             I later gravitated to the guitar.  I've played in a few bands over the years, but there is nothing like the excitement of my first band, Dark Glass.</p>

          <h2>Physical Fitness</h2>
             <p>
               My physical fitness endeavors have been eclectic in nature. While I played football and basketball in highschool
                I didn't focus on these too much.  As an adult, I have enjoyed resistance training,
                running and cycling.  Regarding fitness, I guess you could say, I am the prototypical "Jack of all trades, Master of none." 
                I ran my first half marathon in 2019.  I've ran several half marathons in Missouri: Joplin, Springfield and Kansas City.  
                I've even been down to New Orleans for a run.

         <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <p>I learned to cook out of necessity in my twenties.  I have always enjoyed eating, but as a bachelor
               I needed to curb my desire for dining out.  Over the years, I have developed some skills
               and now work in a kitchen (along with bartending). I consider baking my strength.
